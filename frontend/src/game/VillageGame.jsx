// The Village Game black box. Receives community list + game session as
// props; emits door-entry and admin events. Has no API knowledge, no routing,
// and no imports outside this directory. Drop-in usable from any shell.
//
// Inputs:
//   communities       — array of community objects (id, title, color,
//                       logo_url, category_key, position_order, badges)
//   session           — { spawn: { area, last_community_id } } from /game/session
//   dailyBrief        — a React node rendered into the game's top-right
//                       overlay slot. The shell decides what to render here
//                       (e.g. a daily-brief modal trigger).
//
// Outputs:
//   onEnterCommunity(id)       — player walked onto a community doorway
//   onCreateCommunity(attrs)   — admin pressed Add in the admin panel
//   onDeleteCommunity(id)      — admin pressed Delete on a community row
//
// Sort communities by position_order and drop each onto the next plot of the
// town the game generates. The town size adapts to community count.
